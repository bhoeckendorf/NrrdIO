### The process of creating the NrrdIO source distribution from a teem
### source distribution is automated, and is controlled by this GNU
### makefile:
###
###    make -f pre-GNUmakefile clean
###    make -f pre-GNUmakefile
###
### This file is the single place where the required teem source files
### are listed.  Once the NrrdIO source distribution is created, this
### GNU makefile is completely moot.  TEEM_SRC_ROOT must be set in order
### to locate the teem source.  We use this instead of TEEM_ROOT to avoid
### conflict with teem's own make system

$(if $(TEEM_SRC_ROOT),,\
$(warning *)\
$(warning * Environment variable TEEM_SRC_ROOT not set. This)\
$(warning * needs to be set to the directory containing the)\
$(warning * src and include directories of the Teem source)\
$(warning * distribution.)\
$(warning *)\
$(error Make quitting))

### The following sources are pretty much stubs, to create the symbols, 
### but not the functionality of different formats and the bzip2 encoding.
### As such, they are NOT copied from teem but are made for NrrdIO.
###
NEED_NOT = encodingBzip2.c formatEPS.c formatPNG.c formatPNM.c \
  formatText.c formatVTK.c

### These are still needed for exact same functionality as in teem
###
TEEM_HDRS = $(addprefix teem/, \
  teem32bit.h teemBigbitfield.h teemDio.h \
  teemEndian.h teemPng.h teemQnanhibit.h)

### NEED_{AIR,BIFF,NRRD}: the source files from teem that we need
### NEED_HDRS: the headers that we need
###
NEED_AIR = $(addprefix air/, \
  754.c mop.c array.c parseAir.c dio.c \
  sane.c endianAir.c string.c enum.c miscAir.c)
NEED_BIFF = biff/biffbiff.c
NEED_NRRD = $(addprefix nrrd/, \
  accessors.c defaultsNrrd.c enumsNrrd.c arraysNrrd.c methodsNrrd.c \

### Building NrrdIO requires the teem*.h headers, and the processed sources
### from air, biff, and nrrd
###
.PHONY: all
all: $(TEEM_HDRS) $(NEED_SRCS) $(NEED_PRIV_HDRS) NrrdIO.h NrrdIO_Srcs.txt

### NrrdIO.h is basically the result of cat'ing together all the 
### teem headers in $(NEED_HDRS), but we do need to "unteem" them.
###
$(NEED_PUB_HDRS) $(NEED_PRIV_HDRS):
	tail +19 $(TEEM_SRC_ROOT)/src/$@ \
         | perl unteem.pl \
         | grep -v HAS_BEEN_INCLUDED > $(notdir $@)
NrrdIO.h: $(NEED_PUB_HDRS)
	cat preamble.c $(notdir $(NEED_PUB_HDRS)) > NrrdIO.h
	rm -f $(notdir $(NEED_PUB_HDRS))

### NrrdIO_Srcs.txt is a list of all the source files that must be
### compiled together to create libNrrdIO
###
NrrdIO_Srcs.txt:
	echo $(notdir $(NEED_SRCS)) $(NEED_NOT) > $@

### The teem*.h headers: we need only change the pre-amble here
###
teem/%.h: 
	tail +19 $(TEEM_SRC_ROOT)/include/$(notdir $@) \
          | cat preamble.c - > $(notdir $@)

### The rest: by design, these targets have the library names as part
### of the name (e.g. nrrd/simple.c) and that allows us to locate the
### source file without any VPATH games
###
%.h %.c:
	tail +19 $(TEEM_SRC_ROOT)/src/$@ \
          | cat preamble.c - \
          | perl unteem.pl \
          | grep -v HAS_BEEN_INCLUDED > $(notdir $@)

### To start from scratch
###
clean:
	rm -f $(notdir $(TEEM_HDRS) $(NEED_SRCS) \
                       $(NEED_PUB_HDRS) $(NEED_PRIV_HDRS)) \
