# libNrrdIO
Fork of the [NRRD file format](http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html) implementation from the original [SVN repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/teem/code/HEAD/tree/).

Upstream, libNrrdIO is a subproject that receives externally detected platform-specific configuration. The default branch of this fork ("standalone") includes an adaptation of the external configuration mechanism to produce shared and static libraries directly.
